         <p>Per. 2</p>
         <p>Across the world, the rights of hard-working immigrants are different for those who are native. In some nations, the rights of immigrants are far less than the rights of the nation’s natives. I will be exploring how the labor markets and rights of citizens affect the nations of the U.S and the United Arab Emirates. Immigrants are being mistreated in many nations across the world however the U.S and the United Arab Emirates are only two of them. </p>
         <p>This page is exploring how the immigrants in the labor market are being treated and how their rights are compared to other citizens in the United States and the United Arab Emirates. This is important because how immigrants are treated can affect how these nations can function. People living in these societies need to take charge and make the people who are pushed out of their home countries more equal to the ones who are of origin in their societies.</p>

         <h3>United States</h3>
         <p>Claim 1:
Immigrants that come to the U.S are very important for our society to succeed. Our nation relies on the hard labor that the hard working citizens do. However, many of these immigrants are mistreated and given worse rights than those who are native to the U.S. The source Nfwm.org states that “Once in the U.S, not only do undocumented farm workers face major challenges on the job, but thanks to our current anti-immigrant political climate, they are also marginalized and even criminalized in their own communities. Ironically, immigrants in this ‘Nation of Immigrants’ faced great hostility, dealing with racism and discrimination.” This shows how they are mistreated and how their rights are violated.</p>
         <p>Claim 2: 
The immigrants are also mistreated because they are under-paid for doing more hard-labor. The site http://newlaborforum.cuny.edu/ states “The most astonishing levels of labor code violations are experienced by workers who are paid by the day and in cash. Latinos make up a high percentage of these victims. In the 2008 sample studied by NELP, 63.4 percent were Latino, and the median hourly wage was $8.02.10”. This shows that people and foreigners who do more hard labor than others are being under-paid because they should be paid more than $8 an hour for this sort of labor.</p>
         <p>Counterclaim:
Some may say that the immigrants are taking our jobs. However, we need them to take the hard working jobs that many average Americans won’t take. But, it is wrong for the people not native to the U.S to be mistreated and under-paid for the amount of work they do.</p>
